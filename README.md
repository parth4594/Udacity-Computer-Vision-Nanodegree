1. Facial Keypoint Detection:

   In this project, I have combined the knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any
   image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!
   Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose
   recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. The code looks at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on
   each face. 

2. Image Captioning

   In this project, a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images is created.
   After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train the network, network is tested on novel images!
   
3. Landmark Detection and Tracking (SLAM)

   In this project, I have implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! I have combined what I know about robot sensor measurements and
   movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world
   in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
